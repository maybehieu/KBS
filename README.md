# Knowledge Based System

## Animal-health diagnosis chatbot

### Description
This is a final assignment for my KBS college course, meaning to create a simple system using knowledge.

### Dependencies
This project used the following:
- underthesea: preprocessing Vietnamese-based sentences, mainly for spliting words
- TFIDF
- Cosine similarity

### Idea
Due to the requirements of the course/ final assignment, this project doesn't relies heavily on DL. Mainly focus on using TFIDF to find 'matching' keywords, from then, calculate the similarity between 'cases' which've been pre-defined to what the user've inputed.
